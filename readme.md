This project is to use and test the aqcuired HTML knowledge I have gained so far in the course.

Although I have previous knowledge of HTML it is nice with a project to test my git/github skills and to further stabilize my HTML foundation.

So far my concerns for this project are:

Using git commits properly.
Writing code that is easy to read.
Folder management using the linux terminal.


Log of mistakes and things I have learned

When making this readme file, I meant to change the original readme file, not create a new one.
-I forgot that the original readme file on github is with CAPITAL letters, and so when I typed <code readme.md> into the terminal I created a new file instead of editing the old one.
-I however managed to upload the new file to github in little time, and git is properly setup for the project ^^

The project so far when writing this was really easy and elementary. I did not put a lot of effort into this project as I want to move on.
