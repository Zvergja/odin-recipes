This project is to use and test the aqcuired HTML knowledge I have gained so far in the course.

Although I have previous knowledge of HTML it is nice with a project to test my git/github skills and to further stabilize my HTML foundation.

So far my concerns for this project are:

Using git commits properly.
Writing code that is easy to read.
Folder management using the linux terminal.
